      <p>Netflix’s struggle to boost its subscriber count took a dire turn in the first quarter of 2022. The company reported a
      loss of 200,000 subscribers globally compared to Q4, and it’s forecasting even bigger losses to come. Netflix estimates
      it could lose up to 2 million subscribers in the second quarter.</p>

    <div class= "section">
      <p>“Our revenue growth has slowed considerably,” Netflix acknowledged in its letter to shareholders. “Covid clouded the
      picture by significantly increasing our growth in 2020, leading us to believe that most of our slowing growth in 2021
      was due to the Covid pull forward.” Netflix ended the quarter with roughly 222 million subscribers, so it’s still the
      largest streamer — but it’s facing a slew of challenges. </p>

    <div class= "section">
      <p>The streaming giant has recently indicated it will tighten the screws on customers who share passwords and login info
  as it seeks to maximize revenue from the users it already has. And it’s not a small problem: Netflix now estimates
  that as many as 100 million households are using the service via shared passwords. “It’s harder to grow membership in
      many markets,” as a result of the situation, Netflix said. However, clients on social media complain about the lack of quality content and pricing.</p>
